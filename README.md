  You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the   positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).

  The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump.\n 
  The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2meters per jump. 
  You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. 
  If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.

# For example
  kangaroo 1 starts at x1=2 with a jump distance v1=1 and kangaroo 2 starts at x2=1 with a jump distance of v2=2 . After one jump, they are   both at x=3, (x1+v1=2+1, x2+v2=1+2), so our answer is YES otherwise NO.
